# Obsolete

This fork of git-svn-clone-externals is obsolete. I haven't worked on it in a long time, nor have I *used* it. (Little to no svn:externals in the projects I worked on.)

If you are looking for git-svn-clone-externals, please check out the original project (https://github.com/andrep/git-svn-clone-externals) or one of its more recent forks.
